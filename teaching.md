My goal for teaching is to lower the barrier of entry into the disciplines of embedded systems and robotics for undergraduate students. I also have my own research group called Robotic Assisted Locomotion (RAL) Lab where we study the modeling of novel robot systems and applications to assisting humans in locomotion.
