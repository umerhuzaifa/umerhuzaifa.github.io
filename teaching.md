My goal for teaching is to lower the barrier of entry into the disciplines of embedded systems and robotics for undergraduate students. I also have my own research group called Robotic Assisted Locomotion (RAL) Lab where we study the modeling of novel robot systems and applications to assisting humans in locomotion.

The courses I have developed from span both the fundamentals engineering and computer science, and advanced topics in control systems, robotics and embedded systems.

### Current Schedule: Fall 2025

CSE 351 Embedded Systems I
CSE 361 Mathematical Foundations of Autonomous Systems
