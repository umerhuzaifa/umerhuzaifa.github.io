I am an Assistant Professor and Program Chair of Intelligent Systems Engineering at Jarvis College of Computing and Digital Media, DePaul University.

My goal for teaching is to lower the barrier of entry into the disciplines of embedded systems and robotics for undergraduate students. I also have my own research group called Robotic Assisted Locomotion (RAL) Lab where we study the modeling of novel robot systems and applications to assisting humans in locomotion.



## For Research Opportunity: 

I am looking for student researchers at all levels (undergrad, Masterâ€™s, and PhD), and collaborators. Please feel free to email me about potential projects.
