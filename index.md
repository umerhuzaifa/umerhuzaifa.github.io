I am an Assistant Professor of Cyber-Physical Systems Engineeringat DePaul University, and also chairing the Program Committee for Engineering in the College of Computing and Digital Media.

My goal for teaching is to lower the barrier of entry into the disciplines of embedded systems and robotics for undergraduate students. I also have my own research group called Robotic Assisted Locomotion (RAL) Lab where we study the modeling of novel robot systems and applications to assisting humans in locomotion.



## For Research Opportunity: I am looking for student researchers at all levels (undergrad, Masterâ€™s, and PhD), and collaborators. Please feel free to email me about potential projects.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
