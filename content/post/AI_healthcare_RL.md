# Mathematical Modeling using Machine Learning

## Talking Points

- **Bridging Theory and Data-Driven Approaches:**  
  Traditional models rely on theoretical equations, while ML leverages data to capture complex relationships, providing more accurate predictions. This approach complements systems where theoretical models are too complex to derive or apply efficiently.

- **Hybrid Models: Combining First-Principles and ML:**  
  Hybrid models integrate physical laws with ML to enhance interpretability and predictive power, such as in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). These models are especially useful in robotics, where a mix of control theory and ML helps achieve more adaptive and efficient operations.

- **Modeling Complex Systems with High-Dimensional Data:**  
  ML excels in learning patterns from complex datasets, making it valuable in systems like _walking robots, double pendulums, soft robots, and mobile robots_.  
  Deriving equations of motion for these systems is often time-consuming and requires significant effort.  
  **Reinforcement learning** offers a practical alternative by enabling experimentation over time and identifying optimal behaviors for system operation.

- **Overcoming Limitations of Classical Models with ML:**  
  ML models adapt dynamically and generalize better, especially in unpredictable or noisy scenarios.  
  In _biomechanical modeling_, ML techniques automate the regulation of medicines and fluids in the body.  
  This approach extends to biological systems, where it helps analyze behavior over time and predict responses to medicinal interventions.

- **Applications and Future Directions:**  
  ML-based models are being utilized across diverse domains, including robotics, healthcare, weather forecasting, and financial markets.  
  Reinforcement learning has demonstrated promise in autonomous robot control and biological systems.  
  Future research aims to enhance model transparency, computational efficiency, and interpretability to meet the growing demand for reliable AI systems.
