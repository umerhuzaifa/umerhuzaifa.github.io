<p><strong>Introduction to Robotics for 6-10 Years Old:</strong></p>
<p>I was an invited speaker for the concluding session of <em>Weepro Coding Camp</em>. This was a tough crowd. What could you teach about robotics to such a young cohort? So I went ahead and covered the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a robot?</li>
<li>Different robot types in terms of morphology</li>
<li>A few Actual Robots I had</li>
<li>Moving a Wheeled Robot: How to Translate</li>
<li>Moving a Wheeled Robot: How to Rotate</li>
<li>Moving a Wheeled Robot: Movement and Sensing Together</li>
</ul>
