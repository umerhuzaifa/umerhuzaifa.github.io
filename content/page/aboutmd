I am an Assistant Professor of [Cyber-Physical Systems Engineering](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/BS-in-Cyber-Physical-Systems-Engineering.aspx)at <a href="https://depaul.edu">DePaul University</a>, and also chairing the Program Committee for Engineering in the [College of Computing and Digital Media](https://cdm.depaul.edu).

My goal for teaching is to lower the barrier of entry into the disciplines of embedded systems and robotics for undergraduate students. I also have my own research group called _Robotic Assisted Locomotion (RAL) Lab_ where we study the modeling of novel robot systems and applications to assisting humans in locomotion.

**For Research Opportunity:**
I am looking for student researchers at all levels (undergrad, Master's, and PhD), and collaborators. Please feel free to email me about potential projects.
